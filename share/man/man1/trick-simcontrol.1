.SH DESCRIPTION
The Trick Simulation Control panel (sim_control_panel) sends control commands to a simulation
and views the status of a simulation.

The sim_control_panel is able to start/freeze/unpause/shutdown a simulation.  The sim_control_panel
is also able to turn on/off real-time synchronization and simulation data recording.

The sim_control_panel displays the current running mode of the simulation, the simulation
elapsed time, and status messages outputted by the sim.

The sim_control_panel is used to launch other Trick runtime GUIs including the Trick View,
\fBtrick-tv\fP, and the Malfunctions Trick View, \fBtrick-mtv\fP.
