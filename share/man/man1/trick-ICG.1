.SH NAME
trick-ICG \- run the Trick Interface Code Generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtrick-ICG\fP [OPTIONS]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtrick-ICG\fP \fIstructure_file.h\fP invokes the Trick Interface Code Generator
on the data structures and/or enumerated types definition file
\fIstructure_file.h\fP.
\fBtrick-ICG\fP generates source code (in C++) which is used by the Trick memory manager
to perform input and output to/from the data structures defined in
\fIstructure_file.h\fP.
.PP
\fBtrick-ICG\fP should be executed from the directory containing \fIstructure_file.h\fP.
This may be the model directory itself, or a directory called \fIinclude\fP
in the model directory.  The source code generated by \fBtrick-ICG\fP are placed
in a directory called \fIio_src\fP.
.TP
\fB-D=<define>\fP
Predefine \fIdefine\fP as a macro, with definition 1
.TP
\fB-I=<directory>\fP
Add the directory \fIdirectory\P to the list of directories to be searched for header files.
.TP
\fB-d=<int>\fP
Set the debug level of prints.  Valid values are 0-4.
.TP
\fB-f\fP
Force all io_src files to be regenerated even if they were marked up-to-date.
.TP
\fB-help\fP
Print quick summary of arguments.
.TP
\fB-m\fP
In addition to the io_src files, create the structure map files used by a simulation.  Not
usually run by users.
.TP
\fB-o=<string>\fP
Output all files to \fIstring\fP
.TP
\fB-s\fP
Process the Trick header files when building Trick itself. Should not run outside of building
Trick.
.TP
\fB-units-truth-is-scary\fP
Supress units conversion warnings.
.TP
\fB-v=<int>\fP
Select version of attributes to produce.  Currently 10 is the only valid option.
.TP
\fB-version\fP
Prints the trick-ICG version and exits.
.SH FILES
.TP
\fIio_src/io_\fPstructure_file\fI.cpp\fP
The I/O code is put in files with names of the form:
\fIio_\fPstructure_file\fI.cpp\fP, one for each \fIstructure_file.h\fP processed
by \fBICG\fP.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBtrick-CP\fP(1)
.PP
All Trick model developers and users should go through the tutorial found
in the \fITrick Simulation Environment User Training Materials\fP.
The canonical reference for all Trick commands, files and utilities is the
\fITrick Simulation Environment User's Guide\fP.  Information specific to a
given release of Trick tools is contained in the \fITrick Simulation
Environment Version Description\fP for that release.
.SH HISTORY
1991-2003 : The original \fBtrick-ICG\fP command was written by Rob Bailey

2003-2012 : \fBtrick-ICG\fP ported to Perl by Alex Lin

2013-present : \fBtrick-ICG\fP ported to C++ and uses clang/llvm to parse header files.
