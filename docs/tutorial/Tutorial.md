## Table of Contents
01. [Introduction](ATutIntroduction)<br>
What Trick is, it's goal, the objective of the tutorial, and how to get and install Trick.

01. [A Simple (non-Trick) Simulation](ATutASimpleSim)<br>
Description of a simple cannon ball simulation problem that is used through out this tutorial. Also a non-trick solution to the problem and a discussion of it's limitations.

01. [Architecture of a Trick Simulation](ATutArchitecture)<br>
How the parts of a Trick simulation are organized and assembled.

01. [Building & Running a Trick-based Cannonball Simulation](ATutAnalyticSim)<br>
In this section, we write, build, and execute a Trick-based cannon ball simulation.

01. [Recording Simulation Data](ATutRecordingData)<br>
How to record data from our Trick-based cannon ball simulation.

01. [Plotting Recorded Data](ATutPlottingData)<br>
How to plot our recorded cannon ball data.

01. [Running Real-time](ATutRunningRealtime)<br>
How to synchronize simulation time to real-time, that is, "wall clock time".

01. [Viewing Real-time Data With Trick View](ATutTrickView)<br>
Viewing simulation data while the simulation is running.
   
01. [State Propagation with Numerical Integration](ATutNumericSim)<br>
How to use numeric integration in a Trick simulation to find the next state. 

01. [Dynamic Events - Making Contact](ATutDynamicEvents)<br>
When interesting things happen between simulation times steps.

01. [Trick Variable Server](TutVariableServer)<br>
How to interact with a running simulation.

01. [Monte Carlo](ATutMonteCarlo)<br>
How to enable and use Monte Carlo functionality in your simulation.
