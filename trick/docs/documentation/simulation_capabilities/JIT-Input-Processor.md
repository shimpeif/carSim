A JIT input file is a C++ input file that can be used along side a python input file, or even replace the python input file.  The JIT input file includes "S_source.hh" that gives it access to the entire simulation.  The code in a JIT input file is compiled into a shared library during simulation initialization.  The simulation dynamically opens the shared library and runs a specific function called "run_me" that must be defined in the JIT input file.  There are a couple of advantages to this type of input file.

1.  Once compiled, a JIT input file is orders of magnitude faster to execute than a python equivalent.  That is because there is no python is involved, everything is C++.
2. Full C++ functionality.  Our SWIG/python code cannot access everything in the sim, C++ can.
3. Events and malfunctions written in C++ and inputted through a JIT input file will not impact real-time operations as much as python events.
4. A JIT input file can be loaded and executed from a python input file.  you donâ€™t have to choose one type or the other.

An example JIT input file from SIM_Ball++_L1/RUN_cpp_input/input.cpp

```c++
/*
 To use this as an input file include this file on the command line.
 S_main_${TRICK_HOST_CPU}.exe RUN_<dir>/input.cpp
 Trick will compile and link this file at simulation runtime.  The
 run_me function will automatically be executed during the
 input_processor phase of initialization.

A JIT input file may be used with a python input file or in place of a python input file.  To use a JIT input file from within a python script use the following calls

```python
# jit_compile_and_run specifies the c++ input file, and an optional function name to run.  The function
# must fit the c++ prototype 'extern "C" int function()'.  If no function name is given, the function
# "run_me" is searched for and ran.
trick.jit_compile_and_run("RUN_cpp_input/input.cpp")
trick.jit_compile_and_run("RUN_cpp_input/input.cpp", "run_event_1")

# a c++ library can be compiled and c++ code executed separately.
trick.jit_compile("RUN_cpp_input/input.cpp")
trick.jit_run("RUN_cpp_input/jitlib/libinput.so", "run_event_1")

# executing a c++ function from input.cpp at a later time.  Note: The add_read call will still be
# processed in python causing a real time hit.
trick.add_read(150, """trick.jit_run("RUN_cpp_input/jitlib/libinput.so", "run_event_1")""")
```

To use a JIT input file in place of the normal python input file, use the C++ input file on the command line.

```
./S_main_<TRICK_HOST_CPU>.exe RUN_cpp_input/input.cpp
```
