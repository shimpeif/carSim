<H1>Anatomy of A Plot</H1>
<pre>

Trick plots multiple plots on a "page" and multiple curves on a "plot".
A "page" may have a number of plots and a "plot" may have a number of curves.

In plots:
     Each plot has one or more curves. 

In curves:
     A curve has to be in a plot.
     Each curve has exactly one X variable and one Y variable.
     Or each curve may have one or more varcase (pair of X and Y variables).
     Each varcase has exactly one X variable and one Y variable.
     When a curve already has a variable, it can't add varcase. 
     When a curve already has a varcase, it can't add a variable. 
          In this case, the variable has to be added in the contained varcase.
     Variables have their own attributes such as unit, scale factor, line style, etc. 

In varcase:
     A varcase is used to indicate that two or more variable names mean the same thing.
     If the data for a curve can't be found for the first name, try the second and so forth.

Settings for page, plot and variables are accessed within the property notebook on the bottom right.
A DP spec may have multiple "pages".
