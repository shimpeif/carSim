Good unit tests should prove or verify requirements.

To link your unit tests to requirements, you first need to include the RequirementScribe
class in your unit test:

	#include "trick_utils/reqs/include/RequirementScribe.hh"

Then, instantiate a RequirementScribe class (it's easiest to do this in the test class you
define):
	
	Trick::RequirementScribe scribe;

Finally, to link to a requirement, call the add_requirement function in a testcase and
indicate the tag number of the requirement you want to link to:

	TEST_F(TestSuite, TestCase) {
		scribe.add_requirement("34749701347");
		.
		.
		.
	}

You can add multiple unit tests to the same requirement.

You can also link one unit test to multiple requirements. To do this, make a list of 
the tags passed to "add_requirement" separated by spaces and/or commas:

	scribe.add_requirement("924759056, 247569693 41342435,12312405   34523462346");
