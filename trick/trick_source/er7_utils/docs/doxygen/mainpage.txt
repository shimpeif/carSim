@section code_caveat Caveat on Displayed Source Code

These doxygen pages include facsimiles of the ER7 utilities source code.
A word of warning: These are facsimiles.
Some differences do exist between the true source code and the source presented
in this API documentation. In particular,
  - The line numbers differ between the displayed source and the true source.
  - The combination of the preparation of files for doxygen and the processing
    by doxygen strips some comments from the displayed source.
