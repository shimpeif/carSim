<h2>I brought up trick_dp, but there is nothing there.</h2>
Data needs to be in SIM_/RUN_ prefixed directories. 
Start trick_dp in a directory that contains SIMs/RUNs
SIMs must have a DP_Product directory too.
The DP_Product directory holds DP spec files.

<h2>I don't have any DP files?  How do I make them?</h2>
Select a run, and click the blue lightning bolt icon
to build a DP spec file.

<h2>How do I remove a DP or RUN from the selection box?</h2>
Double click the item in the selection box, it will disappear.

<h2>How do I compare two sets of data?</h2>
Select the two RUNs to compare.  Then select a DP file.
Then click the collate or delta icon. The collate will place
curves from each set of data on the same plot.  The delta will difference
the data point by point where the time stamps match.

<h2>How do I plot multiple variables in the same plot?</h2>
Use quickplot to specify the variables that you want to see. Plotting multiple 
variables in the same plot can be done by adding mutiple curves to the same plot.
Each curve has exactly one X variable and one Y variable. Even though all X variable 
may be the same in the some cases, the X variable still needs to be specified for a curve.
A variable can not be added directly to a plot. It has be added to a curve of a plot.

In quickplot, variable names that are not shared by all selected RUNs are
highlighted in red color.  If there are variables having different names meaning the 
same thing, You have to use "varcase" to generate a plot for those variables.  
Refer to Help in quickplot for instructions on adding curves.

<h2>How do I compare two variables in the same RUN (set of data)?</h2>
You have to use quickplot for this.  See the "function f" icon on quickplot.

<h2>How do I send a plot to a file or printer?</h2>
See general usage.
